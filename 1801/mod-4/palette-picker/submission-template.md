## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I did not finish testing.  I had trouble setting up the testing environment.  I now know how to do that and am going to complete my server side testing this weekend. 

I also need to display the hex values for the color palettes.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/seamus-quinn/palette-picker/blob/971f7f8c531de423348116787b0e0dd705f485aa/public/js/scripts.js#L188-L212)

I made a higher order function that handles everything that happens when a palette is created.  (Appending it to page, posting it to database, then asynchronously giving that dom node a value of the id that was created by the table)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

There were a lot of things that needed to happen when a palette is created and I felt that I was able to organize them.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/seamus-quinn/palette-picker/blob/971f7f8c531de423348116787b0e0dd705f485aa/public/js/scripts.js#L129-L158)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I wanted to iterate over the colors and create divs (react style) but couldn't figure out how to do it

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
